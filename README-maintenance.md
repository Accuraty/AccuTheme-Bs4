## Template Project Maintenance

Simply put, keep Node up to date and ensure that package.json dependencies get updated regularly.

- Review [Node.js Releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) and keep this template in "ACTIVE" releases
- Update `package.json` [details needed]
- Update `ABBV20xx.code-workspace` terminal startup output to match package.json (see Terminal/PowerShell/arge/Write-Host)
- Test
